## Synopsis

This is was an old fun project built in 2015

Career Builder wanted to promote their extensive data on the interview process.
We decided on a parallax page that would help draw the visitors in and maintain their interests throughout the entire work.

I was happy that way it turned out and wanted to share the work I did. 
I used skollr.js. As well as SASS, modernizer.js and grunt.js.
